	# This function takes 1-year NetCDF files from the

	# where filenames for daily mean SST files are named with the scheme
	# sst.day.mean.YEAR.v2.nc
	# _________________________________________________________________

	# Inputs
	# fname: full path to NetCDF data file
	# lsmask: full path to land-sea mask NetCDF file
	# lon1: western-most longitude of search area, must be smaller than lon2
	# lon2: eastern-most longitude of search area, must be larger than lon1
	# lat1: southern-most latitude of search area, must be smaller than lat2
	# lat2: northern-most latitude of search area, must be larger than lat1
	# date1: first date in file to extract, must be Date class
	# date2: last date in file to extract, must be Date class
	# lon2, lat2, date2 are optional.

	# Output
	# A 3-dimensional array with latitudes in rows, longitudes in columns, and
	# dates along the 3rd dimension. The value [1,1,1] is the northernmost,
	# westernmost lat/long location on the 1st date. The value [1,1,2] is the
	# 2nd date at the same lat/long location (if more than 1 date is requested).
	# To extract lat/lon/date values from the output array, use the

	# lats = as.numeric(dimnames(sst2)$Lat)
