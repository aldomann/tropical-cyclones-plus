# NOAA_OISST_ncdf4.R
# Functions to extract mean sea surface temperature data from NOAA's Optimum
# Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) v2 High Resolution daily or
# weekly datasets.
# Daily data are available on a 1/4? global grid.
# Weekly data are available on a 1? global grid.
# Windows users, note that you'll need to manually download the ncdf4 package
# from http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncdf/, since it is not available
# directly from CRAN. David Pierce is the author of the ncdf4 package.

# See http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html
# for information about the year-long OISST v2 daily files.

# See http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html
# for more information about the weekly OISST v2 files

# See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sst/griddata.php
# for more information about the single-day AVHRR OISST files

# Once that file is downloaded to your computer, open a version of Rgui.exe

  # The 1-day OISST v2 high resolution files come as gz-compressed NetCDF
  # files. You MUST unzip those files before trying to use this function.
  # Obtain the files from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sst/griddata.php
  # or directly from ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily-v2/NetCDF/

  # These are essentially just smaller single-day versions of the much
  # larger one-year files that contain daily data that are available at
  # ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/noaa.oisst.v2.highres/
  # ______________________________________________________________________
  # Inputs
  # fname: full path to unzipped NetCDF data file
  # lsmask: full path to land-sea mask NetCDF file
  # lonW: western-most longitude of search area, must be smaller than lonE
  # lonE: eastern-most longitude of search area, must be larger than lonW
  # latS: southern-most latitude of search area, must be smaller than latN
  # latN: northern-most latitude of search area, must be larger than latS
  # lonE, latN are optional.

  # Output
  # A 2-dimensional matrix with latitudes in rows and longitudes in columns.
  # The value [1,1] is the northernmost,
  # westernmost lat/long location on the 1st date.
  # To extract lat/lon values from the output array, use the
  # dimnames() function:
  # lats = as.numeric(dimnames(sst2)$Lat)
  # longs = as.numeric(dimnames(sst2)$Long)

  # NetCDF files should be downloaded from the links on:
  # ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily-v2/NetCDF/

  # In addition to the temperature data files, also download a copy of the
  # landmask file lsmask.oisst.v2.nc from:
  # http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html

  # Inside the NetCDF files, data are available on a
  # 0.25? latitude x 0.25? longitude global grid (720x1440 cells)
  # From -89.875N to 89.875N, 0.125E to 359.875E.
  # Locations are at the CENTER of a grid cell.
  # Southern Hemisphere latitudes must be given as NEGATIVE degrees NORTH.
  # For example, the Tropic of Capricorn is at roughly -23.43? north.
  # All longitudes must be given as positive degrees EAST of the prime
  # meridian. For example, Los Angeles is at roughly 241.77? east.
