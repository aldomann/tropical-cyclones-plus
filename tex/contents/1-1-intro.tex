For the North Atlantic (N.~Atl.) and Northeast Pacific (E.~Pac.) basin, it has been shown \cite{Corral2010} that the probability distribution of the so-called power-dissipation index ($PDI$, a rough estimation of released energy) is affected by the annual and basin-wide averaged sea surface temperature (SST), displacing towards more extreme values on warm years (high-SST).

As the $PDI$ integrates (cubic) wind speed over tropical-cyclone (TC) lifetime, it is an open question where the $PDI$ increase comes from (higher speed, longer lifetime, or both).
