abstract = {The influence of climate variability and global warming on the occurrence of tropical cyclones (TC) is a controversial issue. Existing historical databases on the subject are not fully reliable, but a more fundamental hindrance is the lack of basic understanding regarding the intrinsic nature of tropical cyclone genesis and evolution. It is known that tropical cyclones involve more than a passive response to changing external forcing, but it is not clear which dynamic behaviour best describes them. Here we present a new approach based on the application of the power dissipation index (PDI), which constitutes an estimation of released energy, to individual tropical cyclones. A robust law emerges for the statistics of PDI, valid in four different ocean basins and over long time periods. In addition to suggesting a novel description of the physics of tropical cyclones in terms of critical phenomena, the law allows to quantify their response to changing climatic conditions, with an increase in the largest PDI values with sea surface temperature or the presence of El Nino phenomenon, depending on the basin under consideration. In this way, we demonstrate that the recent upswing in North Atlantic hurricane activity does not involve TCs quantitatively different from those in other sustained high-activity periods prior to 1970.},

(NHC's area extends from the North and Central America west coast westward to 140oW and CPHC's area extends from 140 to 180oW. These analyses make use of all available observations, including those that may not have been available in real-time. NHC and CPHC have traditionally disseminated the tropical cyclone historical database in a format known as HURDAT (short for HURricane DATabase – Davis et al. 1984). This report updates the original HURDAT documentation to reflect significant changes to both the format and content for the tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones of the Northeast and North Central Pacific basin.},

abstract = {Theory and modelling predict that hurricane intensity should increase with increasing global mean temperatures, but work on the detection of trends in hurricane activity has focused mostly on their frequency and shows no trend. Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and--taking into account an increasing coastal population--a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the number of tropical cyclones as a function of the energy they release is a decreasing power-law function, up to a characteristic energy cutoff determined by the spatial size of the ocean basin in which the storm occurs. This means that no characteristic scale exists for the energy of tropical cyclones, except for the finite-size effects induced by the boundaries of the basins. This has important implications for the physics of tropical cyclones. We discuss up to what point tropical cyclones are related to critical phenomena (in the same way as earthquakes, rainfall, etc.), providing a consistent picture of the energy balance in the system. Moreover, this perspective allows one to visualize more clearly the effects of global warming on tropical-cyclone occurrence.},

This paper estimates the uncertainty (average error) for Atlantic basin best track parameters through a survey of the NHC Hurricane Specialists who maintain and update the Atlantic hurricane database. A comparison is then made with a survey conducted over a decade ago to qualitatively assess changes in the uncertainties.

abstract = {Abstract Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of tropical cyclone wind speeds are calculated using best track data from the North Atlantic and western North Pacific basins. Wind speeds are normalized by theoretical potential wind speeds derived from reanalysis datasets, and the individual storms are classified according to whether their maximum intensities were limited by landfall, passage over cold water, or other factors. For each classification, CDFs were calculated and the evolution of the storm wind speed was composited relative to the time at which each storm achieved its lifetime maximum wind speed. For storms of hurricane strength whose maximum intensity is not limited by declining potential intensity (landfall or passage over cold water), the normalized CDFs of storm lifetime maximum wind speed are nearly linear, in contrast to the lognormal distributions found with many other geophysical phenomena, such as earthquakes. Thus there is a roughly equal likelihood that any given tropical cyclone ...},

The techniques employed for the characterization of these materials were ICP-MS, TEM, XRD, BET, and XAS. Au L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were carried out over a series of rare earth materials containing gold nanoparticles. The size of gold nanoparticles varied in the range of ???2 to 6 nm in the Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La materials. These materials possess surface areas ranging from 29 to 41 m2/g with the high phase purity and crystallinity of the support (Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La) materials. An X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES, EXAFS) technique was used in obtaining critical information about the atomic distances, bonding and neighbouring environment for gold atoms in the rare earth Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La oxide materials for understanding the typical characteristics and structure of gold nanoparticles in these materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In order to characterize these correlations we measure conditional recurrence-time and magnitude distributions for worldwide seismicity as well as for Southern California during stationary periods. Disregarding the spatial structure, we conclude that the relevant correlations in seismicity are those of the recurrence time with previous recurrence times and magnitudes; in the latter case, the conditional distribution verifies a scaling relation depending on the difference between the magnitudes of the two events defining the recurrence time. In contrast, with our present resolution, magnitude seems to be independent on the history contained in the seismic catalogs (except perhaps for Southern California for very short time scales, less than about 30??min for the magnitude ranges analyzed). ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract Observations and numerical simulators of tropical cyclones show that evaporation from the sea surface is essential to the development of reasonably intense storms. On the other hand, the CISK hypothesis, in the form originally advanced by Charney and Eliassen, holds that initial development results from the organized release of preexisting conditional instability. In this series of papers, we explore the relative importance of ambient conditional instability and air-sea latent and sensible heat transfer in both the development and maintenance of tropical cyclones using highly idealized models. In particular, we advance the hypothesis that the intensification and maintenance of tropical cyclones depend exclusively on self-induced heat transfer from the ocean. In this sense, these storms may be regarded as resulting from a finite amplitude air-sea interaction instability rather than from a linear instability involving ambient potential buoyancy. In the present paper, we attempt to show that reasona...},
